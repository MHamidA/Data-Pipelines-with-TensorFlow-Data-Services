# Data Pipelines with TensorFlow Data Services

Coursera (DeepLearning.AI)

File archive for Data Pipelines with TensorFlow Data Services course on Coursera that developed by DeepLearning.AI

Week 1:
- Introductory of TF Datasets
- ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load)
- Analyze the metadata and information of each dataset
- Create a streamlined pipeline for model training
- Assignment:  TFDS with Rock, Paper and Scissors

week 2:
- split parameter in tfds.load
- Compare Python slicing operation with Splits API
- Explore TFRecords and individual samples in a dataset
- Investigate feature descriptors
- Identify applications of the Splits API to create custom dataset splits and examine TFRecords and Feature descriptors which help you gain more information about your dataset
- Load a pre-trained feature vector and create custom train/test/validation set splits using Splits API which makes it easier to load data for training and evaluation in your ML pipeline
- Assignment: Transfer Learning and Splits API

Week 3:
- Use different libraries and techniques to export your data into new training pipelines
- Practice with pre-built pipelines that reduce your development time significantly
- Create different feature columns using functions like bucketing, hashing and tokenizing
- Compare and contrast different data types present in TensorFlow Data class with the practice quiz while elaborating more on data operations like one-hot encoding, bucketing and tokenizing
- Apply various data operations in the assignment to create different types of feature columns which you see frequently in different ML problem statements, compile and train them on a custom csv dataset that is loaded using tf.Data API
- Assignment: Classify Structured Data

Week 4:
- Identify bottlenecks in your input pipelines
- Improve your pipelines impacting your model training
- Learn about caching and parallelizing your inputs
- Assignment: Parallelization with TFDS
- Optional : Publishing your Datasets, Colab
