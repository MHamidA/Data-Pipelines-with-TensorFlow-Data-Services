File archive for Data Pipelines with TensorFlow Data Services course on Coursera that developed by DeepLearning.AI

Week 1:
- Introductory of TF Datasets
- ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load)
- Analyze the metadata and information of each dataset
- Create a streamlined pipeline for model training
- Assignment:  TFDS with Rock, Paper and Scissors

week 2:
- split parameter in tfds.load
- Compare Python slicing operation with Splits API
- Explore TFRecords and individual samples in a dataset
- Investigate feature descriptors
- Identify applications of the Splits API to create custom dataset splits and examine TFRecords and Feature descriptors which help you gain more information about your dataset
- Load a pre-trained feature vector and create custom train/test/validation set splits using Splits API which makes it easier to load data for training and evaluation in your ML pipeline
- Assignment: Transfer Learning and Splits API
